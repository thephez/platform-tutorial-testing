# Evo-SDK Read-Only Tutorial Example (Lightweight Runner)

This page demonstrates a lightweight, in-page click-to-run runner using Sandpack instead of an
embedded StackBlitz IDE.

- Focus: better responsiveness while preserving interactive docs behavior.
- Tutorial mapping: representative read-only connection-check flow.

## Run the example

<TutorialRunner />

## Notes

1. This PoC favors responsiveness over full remote IDE features.
2. For full-repo workflows, keep optional "Open in Codespaces" links.
3. Start with read-only tutorials, then add credentialed guidance where needed.
