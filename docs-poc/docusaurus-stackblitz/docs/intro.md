# Interactive Docs PoC

This is a proof of concept for hosting Evo-SDK tutorials in Docusaurus while enabling interactive,
click-to-run execution via StackBlitz.

## Goals

- Keep docs authoring in Markdown/MDX.
- Provide immediate run capability for read-only tutorials.
- Offer a pattern that can be extended for credentialed tutorials.
