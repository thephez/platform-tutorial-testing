# Interactive Docs PoC

This is a proof of concept for hosting Evo-SDK tutorials in Docusaurus with a lightweight,
click-to-run in-page experience.

## Goals

- Keep docs authoring in Markdown/MDX.
- Provide immediate run capability for read-only tutorials.
- Prioritize responsiveness over full embedded IDE weight.
