The Dash Platform Name System (DPNS) maps human-readable names to identity IDs, similar
to how DNS maps domain names to IP addresses. Resolving a name returns the DPNS document
containing the identity ID, label, and other registration details. This tutorial
demonstrates looking up a registered name to find the associated identity.
