Dash Platform divides time into epochs, each representing a fixed period of blocks. Epoch
information includes the start and end block heights, fee multiplier, and protocol
version active during that epoch. This tutorial retrieves data for a range of epochs,
allowing you to examine how network parameters have changed over time.
