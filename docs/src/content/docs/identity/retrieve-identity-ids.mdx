A single mnemonic can be used to create multiple identities on Dash Platform. The SDK
uses DIP-9 derivation paths to deterministically derive identity keys from a mnemonic,
then queries the network to find which identities were registered with those keys. This
tutorial demonstrates how to enumerate all identity IDs associated with a given mnemonic.
