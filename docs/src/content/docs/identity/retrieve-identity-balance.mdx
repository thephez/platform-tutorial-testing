Every identity on Dash Platform has a credit balance used to pay for state transitions
such as registering names, publishing contracts, and creating documents. The balance is
denominated in credits, where 1 Dash equals 100,000,000,000 credits. This tutorial
retrieves the current credit balance for a given identity.
