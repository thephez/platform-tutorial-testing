Identities are the foundation of Dash Platform. Every user and application on the
network has a unique identity identified by a 256-bit ID. Retrieving an identity
returns its balance (in credits), revision number, and associated public keys. This
tutorial demonstrates how to fetch an identity by its ID using the SDK.
